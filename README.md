**Kurakani**, (meaning "conversation" in Nepali), is a web-based real-time chat app that allows users to join a shared group chat, send messages â€” all in real time.

This project was built as a learning experience to understand:
- How real-time communication works using Socket.IO
- The full development cycle from backend to frontend
- Authentication using JWT
- Deploying full-stack apps using modern cloud platforms

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Deployment**:
  - Frontend: Vercel
  - Backend: Render

### Features

-  JWT-based authentication (Login/Signup)
-  Real-time messaging using Socket.IO
-  Active user count display
-  "Someone is typing..." indicator
-  Fully responsive layout with Tailwind CSS

### Limitations (Planned Improvements)

- Currently supports only one default system-created group
- No option to create or switch between groups
- No private messaging yet

> These limitations are intentional to keep the focus on core real-time communication. Future updates will include these features.
